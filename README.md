check_zpools
============

A Nagios/Icinga plugin to monitor ZFS Pools (zpools).
It is based on "Check Solaris ZFS Pools" but is completely rewritten.

For my environment with different OS using ZFS (Solaris, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD) I needed a Nagios plugin which is running on all OS. 

Based on my research (http://www.claudiokuenzler.com/blog/345/monitor-zfs-disk-pools-nagios-plugin-comparison) I finally decided to take an existing plugin and rewrite it.
